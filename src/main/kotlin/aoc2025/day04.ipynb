       "<p>Decorating here will be easy: they can make their own decorations. What you really need is a way to get further into the North Pole base while the elevators are offline.</p> \n",
       "<p>\"Actually, maybe we can help with that,\" one of the Elves replies when you ask for help. \"We're pretty sure there's a cafeteria on the other side of the back wall. If we could break through the wall, you'd be able to keep moving. It's too bad all of our forklifts are so busy moving those big rolls of paper around.\"</p> \n",
